Declaration of War
The Sovereign State of Gremlantis
⠀
Whereas the Banana Republic has engaged in the mass production, hoarding, and unregulated distribution of potassium-laden bananas;
Whereas such unchecked accumulation of potassium has destabilized the divided land of Discordia, spreading disorder and undermining the well-being of its inhabitants;
Whereas the actions of the Banana Republic demonstrate a disregard for the balance, stability, and fair management of virtual resources shared across Discordia;
Whereas the Head of State of the Sovereign State of Gremlantis, pursuant to Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution of Gremlantis, holds the authority and responsibility to manage and protect the server, enforce the Constitution, and safeguard the welfare of its citizens;
Now, therefore, the Sovereign State of Gremlantis formally addresses the Banana Republic with the following proclamation:
Effective immediately, the Sovereign State of Gremlantis recognizes the conduct of the Banana Republic regarding mass potassium production as a violation of principles necessary to maintain order and stability in Discordia. In response to these actions, a state of war is hereby declared between Gremlantis and the Banana Republic.
The Banana Republic is hereby notified that the accumulation of potassium to such extraordinary levels constitutes a threat to the balance and security of Discordia, and such conduct is unacceptable under the oversight of Gremlantis’ constitutional authority.
⠀

3. The Sovereign State of Gremlantis reserves the right to enforce measures necessary to restore stability and balance, consistent with its constitutional mandate, until such time as the Banana Republic ceases the disruptive production and distribution of potassium.
